The following CSS code snippet has an uncommon error that's easy to miss:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
  flex: 1;
}
```

This code aims to distribute three or more `.item` elements evenly within a `.container`. However, if you only have two `.item` elements, `justify-content: space-between` will cause unexpected spacing.  The last item will be pushed to the far right edge and only one space will be between the two items.
